# spelchek.rs
A very basic spellchecker written in Rust using ratatui.

# Dictionary
The included dictionary (or rather list of words in the English language) is one I found in [this repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words). It should be copied to `$HOME/.spelchek/dict.txt` in order for the program to recognise it.
